# About Enumcrt
Enumcrt is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using CRTSH.The traffic sent to enumcrt.py gets reflected in the website CRTSH.CRTSH is a  Certificate Transparency (CT) website which is used to perform a Certificate Search. This simple python tool scrapes the website and loads all subdomain obtain as result.

# Enumcrt overload

While enumerating subdomains of certain sites like (Google,Yahoo...) the tool may not respond.This is due the slow response from the CRTSH site and hence enumeration of huge list of domain is not possible.Even though the tool can easily crawl up to 2000+ URLs if available.


# Installation and Requirements

This requires Python 2.7 and We will soon release an update which supports Python 3.x

`git clone https://github.com/Tibinsunny/enumcrt.git`

Enumcrt depends on the json, urllib, and argparse python modules.
